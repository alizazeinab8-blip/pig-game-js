# Pink Game (Pig Game) – JavaScript Practice Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a *two‑player dice game* built using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*.  
Players take turns rolling a dice, and as long as the dice does *not* show the number *1, the rolled value is added to their **current score*.  
The player can choose to *Hold*, which saves the current score to their total score and passes the turn to the next player.

The goal of this project is to practice game logic, state management, event handling, and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript.

## 🎮 Game Rules
- The game is played between *two players*  
- On each turn, the player rolls the dice:
  - If the dice shows *1*:
    - The player's *current score resets to 0*
    - The turn switches to the other player  
  - If the dice shows any number other than 1:
    - The value is added to the *current score*
    - The player may roll again  
- The player can click *Hold*:
  - The current score is added to the *total score*
  - The turn switches to the next player  
- The first player to reach the target score (e.g., *100 points*) wins the game
